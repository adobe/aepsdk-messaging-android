# Viewing in-app message reports

 For the last part of the tutorial, we will review user activity with our in-app message via reporting in **Adobe Journey Optimizer**.

2. Navigate to the **Journey Optimizer** UI by selecting the nine-dot menu in the top right (**1**), and selecting `Journey Optimizer` (**2**).
