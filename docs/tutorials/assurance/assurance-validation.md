* Inspect and validate SDK events
* Verify extension versions and configuration
* View SDK logs, device information

* Much more!

### Connecting the InappTutorialApp to Assurance

    * If you are not on the iOS Simulator's _Home_ screen, get there by pressing **(âŒ˜ + Shift + H)**.

2. Right-click in the address bar and select **Paste and Go**.

3. A dialog box should appear prompting you to open the page in the **InappTutorialApp**. Click **Open**.
    * If this dialog doesn't appear, try copying the Assurance link again from Step 5 above.

### Using the In-App Messaging plugin

Now that the app is connected to Assurance, we can see events beginning to flow in from the SDK. Since we are specifically working on in-app messages, we can use a more customized view to help us by installing the **In-App Messaging** plugin.

1. In the bottom left of the Assurance UI, click the **Configure** button. 

2. Click the **+** button next to **In-App Messaging** (**1**) when the list of available plugins appears. Then hit the **Save** button (**2**).

| ![Install In-App Messaging plugin](assets/assurance-install-messaging-plugin.png?raw=true) |
| :---: |
| **Install In-App Messaging plugin** |

3. Click on **In-App Messaging** in the left side navigation panel (**1**). 

This plugin has three tabs across the top (**2**) that provide three new, in-app messaging specific views.

    * Messages being displayed and dismissed
    * Custom user interactions with the message
